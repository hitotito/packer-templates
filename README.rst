Maybe you prefer official Ubuntu and CentOS vagrant boxes
=========================================================

There are now official Ubuntu and CentOS vagrant boxes at `Vagrant Cloud <https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search?utm_source=vagrantcloud.com&vagrantcloud=1>`_. These boxes are regularly updated to have newer packages.
If you don't need to build a customized box, maybe you can use those boxes instead of building boxes yourself using Packer and templates in this repository.
